## Introduction
This project was made because I liked the templating workflow that's present in Ansible,
but I found that installing Ansible just for the templating is kind of inconvenient.

So here we have the jinja templating system ingesting YAML, all run via some click CLI commands.  
No inventory, group_vars, hostnames, or other Ansible-related considerations necessary.
